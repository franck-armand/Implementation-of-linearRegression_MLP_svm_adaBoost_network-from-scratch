1. The folders ("classification" and "regression") contain classification and regression datasets respectively.
2. Each dataset includes three data files, all in csv format, in which the training set has 10000 samples, and the validation set and test set have 1000 samples each.
3. The training set and validation set contain label information to train and validate the model. The test dataset is used to evaluate the learning performance of the model. 
4. Please write the results of the test set into column y of "classification_test.csv" and "regression_test.csv" files. The classification result is 0 or 1, and the regression prediction is a real number.
5. For evaluation, accuracy and mse (mean squared error) are used as performance metrics for classification and regression datasets respectively.
