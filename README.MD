# **Model implementation from scratch** 
In this repository, we implemented the following models from scratch (*without using third party libraries*)

- [x] **Regression model**
- [x] **MLP (Multi-layer Perceptron) model**
- [x] **Adaboost model**
- [x] **SVM (Support Vector Machine),**

*The implementation of the SVM model,was done using third party libray, but the parameters such as penalty factor C and kernel were manually set.)*

## **Requirements**
1. **The folders ("classification" and "regression") contain classification and regression datasets respectively.**
2. **Each dataset includes three data files, all in csv format, in which the training set has 10000 samples, and the validation set and test set have 1000 samples each.**
3. **The training set and validation set contain label information to train and validate the model. The test dataset is used to evaluate the learning performance of the model.**

4. **The results of each prediction 'y' of the models is added to the model file. The classification result is 0 or 1, and the regression prediction is a real number**.

5. **The models were also implemented with ``Sklearn`` in order to compare each prediction and model accuracy.**
